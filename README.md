# elevator
One of my first Java projects: an elevator animation

Going through some old files I came across this. As a fun project I decided to see if I could still compile and run it. Before I learned about Git, I had organized the history as a set of numbered folders, so this will try to recreate that history as a series of commits. Should be fun!

The problem came from Appendix F of Deitel and Deitel's *Java: How to Program*, 3rd ed.
